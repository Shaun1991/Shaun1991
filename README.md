### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science professional with experience working for Fortune 500 companies. I have over five years of hands-on experience working within Data Analytics teams.

In 2020, I obtained a data science certificate where I completed two end-to-end capstone projects utilizing Python pandas, data visualization, and more. I am currently doing a part-time Master of Science in Analytics program at Georgia Tech.
